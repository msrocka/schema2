  "description": "A data quality system (DQS) in openLCA describes a pedigree matrix of $m$ data quality indicators (DQIs) and $n$ data quality scores (DQ scores). Such a system can then be used to assess the data quality of processes and exchanges by tagging them with an instance of the system $D$ where $D$ is a $m * n$ matrix with an entry $d_{ij}$ containing the value of the data quality score $j$ for indicator $i$.\nAs each indicator in $D$ can only have a single score value, $D$ can be stored in a vector $d$ where $d_i$ contains the data quality score for indicator $i$. The possible values of the data quality scores are defined as a linear order $1 \\dots n$. In openLCA, the data quality entry $d$ of a process or exchange is stored as a string like `(3;2;4;n.a.;2)` which means the data quality score for the first indicator is `3`, for the second `2` etc. A specific value is `n.a.` which stands for _not applicable_.\nIn calculations, these data quality entries can be aggregated in different ways. For example, the data quality entry of a flow $f$ with a contribution of `0.5 kg` and a data quality entry of `(3;2;4;n.a.;2)` in a process $p$ and a contribution of `1.5 kg` and a data quality entry of `(2;3;1;n.a.;5)` in a process $q$ could be aggregated to `(2;3;2;n.a.;4)` by applying an weighted average and rounding.\nFinally, custom labels like `A, B, C, ...` or `Very good, Good, Fair, ...` for the DQ scores can be assigned by the user. These labels are then displayed instead of `1, 2, 3 ...` in the user interface or result exports. However, internally the numeric values are used in the data model and calculations.\n"
