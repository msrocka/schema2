# schema2

This is an experimental version of the [openLCA
schema](https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-schema) using [JSON
Schema](https://json-schema.org) as definition language. Currently, it is
generated from the YAML files in the `dev` branch of the openLCA schema
repository but this may change.

## Building from source

See the `build_from_yaml.py` script. The documentation is created via
[JSON Schema for Humans](https://github.com/coveooss/json-schema-for-humans).
